				<p>I hold an MBA in Business Administration, which has, with my background in Graphic Design and Photography lead to positions in Executive Leadership, Business Administration and Marketing; I combine the creative knowledge from my design degree with the analytical learnings from my MBA to have a unique perspective in business. I am a 43 year old female and I live in Seattle.</p>
				<p>I am taking this class in order to build my digital skills and be able to better communicate in an online environment. My hope is that this will open up more managerial level positions in tech, by combining my existing people skills along with these new techinical skills.
